class RemoteControliMotions:
    """
    This class provides an interface to control the iMotions software remotely.

    The class is designed to be integrated within an experiment, allowing for the
    initiation of studies, sending of commands, and receiving responses from
    the iMotions software.

    Methods:
    --------
    - __init__(self, study, participant_info, dummy=False): Initializes the class with
    study and participant details.
    - connect(self): Establishes a connection to the iMotions software.
    - start_study(self): Initiates a study in iMotions.
    - end_study(self): Ends the current study in iMotions.
    - abort_study(self): Aborts the current study in iMotions.
    - export_data(self): Exports data from the iMotions software.
    - close(self): Closes the connection to the iMotions software.

    Example Usage:
    --------------
    ```python
    from src.experyment.imotions import RemoteControliMotions

    imotions_control = RemoteControliMotions(
        study="dummy_study",
        participant_info={"id": "P001", "age": 20, "gender": "Female"},
        dummy=True,
    )
    imotions_control.connect()
    imotions_control.start_study()
    # run the experiment ...
    imotions_control.end_study()
    imotions_control.close()
    ```

    Notes:
    ------
    - Ensure that the iMotions software is running with the Remote Control API enabled.
    - The query structure for communication follows a specific format,
      e.g., "R;2;TEST;STATUS\\r\\n", where the query parts are:
        - R: Represents a specific command or operation.
        - 2: Represent a version or type of the command. Different queries need
          different versions.
        - TEST: Is a placeholder or specific command identifier. Not used here.
        - STATUS: Is the actual command or operation to be performed. Always at index 3.
        - \\r\\n: The end of the query (with only one backslash)
    -> See the iMotions Remote Control API documentation for more details and
       the different versions of the commands.

class EventRecievingiMotions:

    This class provides an interface to send discrete markers / continuous event data to
    the iMotions software.

    Methods:
    --------
    - __init__(self, sample_rate, dummy=False): Initializes the class with the sample
      rate for the rate limiter and a dummy mode.
    - connect(self): Establishes a connection to the iMotions software for event
      receiving.
    - send_marker(self, marker_name, value): Sends a specific marker with a given value
      to iMotions.
    - send_prep_markers(self): Sends a start and end marker for the preparation phase of
      the pain stimulus (ramp on and off).
    - send_stimulus_markers(self, seed): Sends a start/end marker for a given seed value
      of a stimulus function.
    - send_data_rate_limited(self, timestamp, temperature, rating, debug=False): Sends
      temperature and rating data from the pain-measurement experiment to iMotions.
    - close(self): Closes the connection to the iMotions software.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The message types are: 'E' for Sensor Event and 'M' for Discrete Marker.
    - iMotions supports both TCP and UDP network connections for event receiving.
      In this class, TCP is used (more reliable and ordered data transfer compared
      to UDP, but slower).
    - iMotions can receive data from many event sources, and each event source can
      support multiple sample types.
    - An additional event source definition file (XML text file) is used to describe the
      samples that can be received from a source.
